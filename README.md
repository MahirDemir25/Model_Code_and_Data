We present our code and data in the folder:

CODES:

1_Bosmina_in_SSM.R : this file presents the R code for the predator prey system (Eq.1 in Manuscript) for Bosmina Combined Sites

2_Model_fit.R : We make paramater estimates of our State Space Model (SSM) in this file 

3_Profile_alpha.R : To capture Confident intervals and profile of a paramater we use this file and visualize  plots and CIs in the “Profile_Analysis.R” file


All the explanatipons about codes in these three files given in the R markdown file : “R_codes_in_SSM_June14_2024”
